# Setting up the Project
First you'll need Node.js and the package manager that comes with it: npm.

Once you've got that working, head to the command line where we'll set up our project.

## Clone the Tutorial
```
git clone https://github.com/xdyang1986/React-router-tutorial-V4.git
cd react-router-tutorial-V4
cd lessons/01-setting-up
npm install
npm start
```
Now open up http://localhost:3000/

Feel free to poke around the code to see how we're using webpack and npm scripts to run the app.

You should see a "This is our first react-router V4 tutorial" message in the browser.

## Make Some Changes
Open up src/App.js and change the text to something like "Hello ". The browser automatically reloads with your new code.
